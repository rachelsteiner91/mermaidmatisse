    <p>Tap into the art world with a simple, and powerful web and mobile-centric tool that helps you easily swipe to discover and virtually 'collect' art. This platform is for people who are open to learning about lesser known artists and want to trust their own decisions based off of what they like, and their tastes. Users will be shown an assortment of images, mainly paintings, prints and other mediums of art -- based on their selections, this will bring them to the next phase in the funnel which will resemble that of a feed displaying various works by emerging artists. The user, which we call “curator” has the ability to create their own tailored art collection and feed of favorites, through the familiar action of a ‘like’ or 'collect art'. The goal is to guide you (the curator) to discover art in a fun, engaging and accessible way.</p>
